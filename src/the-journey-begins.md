Lately, I have been busy --- busy exploring the world of DevOps. At the start of the year, I wanted to try out something besides coding. While I still actively code, this new thrill wouldn't let me be.

Truth be told, I wasn't sure what I really wanted to do, and I didn't want to dive into something I wasn't passionate about, like my Blockchain experience last year. This isn't me coming for the technology, no. I was just bored with the whole thing -- to think I even paid for it. I think maybe it's because I couldn't see the big picture. I'm still doing some soul-searching, though, but for now --- nah! I'll pass.

Fortunately, I came across the [SheCodeAfrica](https://shecodeafrica.org/) cloud technical deep dive program championed by the SCA Lagos chapter, and the good news is, I'm not bored üòÅ. The challenges so far, and the ones I personally heaped on myself, have made this possible.

Although I'm going for DevOps, the program seems to be focused on the cloud, specifically AWS. It's been interesting so far, but what I find really fascinating is the vast estate of resources that is Amazon Web Services. It keeps unraveling, and no, I won't stress myself to know it all.

I'm really enjoying DevOps and looking forward to sharing my experience here.

Alrighty! Ciao, till my next note üôå.
